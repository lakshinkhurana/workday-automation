## üîß How It Works

1. **Navigation**: Automatically navigates to the job posting page
2. **Job Selection**: Finds and clicks on job title links
3. **Application Flow**: Handles the "Apply" ‚Üí "Apply Manually" flow
4. **Account Creation**: Creates account if needed using provided information
5. **Form Filling**: Fills out all application forms across multiple pages:
   - My Information (personal details, contact info)
   - My Experience (work history, skills)
   - Application Questions (job-specific questions)
   - Voluntary Disclosures (EEO information)
   - Self Identify (disability status)
6. **Form Submission**: Submits completed forms

## üéØ Supported Field Types

- **Text Fields**: Name, email, phone, address, etc.
- **Date Fields**: Individual month/day/year spinbutton inputs
- **Dropdown Fields**: Select dropdowns and searchable dropdowns
- **Radio Buttons**: Yes/No questions, multiple choice
- **Checkboxes**: Terms acceptance, preferences
- **Textarea Fields**: Long text responses

## üîç Field Detection Strategy

The system uses multiple strategies to find form fields:

1. **ID Attribute**: `input[id="fieldName"]`
2. **Data Automation ID**: `input[data-automation-id="fieldName"]`
3. **Name Attribute**: `input[name="fieldName"]`
4. **Partial Matching**: `input[id*="fieldName"]`

## üìä Form Data Extraction

The system extracts form structure and saves it to `workday_forms_complete.json` including:

- Field labels and IDs
- Field types (text, select, radio, checkbox)
- Required field indicators
- Available options for dropdowns
- Page metadata

## üêõ Debugging

Enable detailed logging by checking the console output. The system provides:

- Field detection attempts
- Successful/failed form fills
- Selector strategies used
- Error messages and troubleshooting info

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Rate Limiting**: The system includes delays to avoid overwhelming servers
- **Browser Visibility**: Runs in non-headless mode for monitoring
- **Manual Intervention**: Some complex fields may require manual completion
- **Company-Specific**: May need adjustments for different Workday implementations

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All personal information is stored locally in the `.env` file
- No data is transmitted to external servers except the target Workday site
