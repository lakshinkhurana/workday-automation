## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the main automation script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Direct Form Filling

For direct form filling on an already opened page:

```bash
python direct_form_filler.py
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
workday-automation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                     # Main automation flow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ direct_form_filler.py       # Direct form filling logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config_manager.py       
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resume_fill.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance_monitor.py       
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                       # Environment variables (create this)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workday_forms_complete.json # Extracted form data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                    # License file
```

## üîß How It Works

1. **Navigation**: Automatically navigates to the job posting page
2. **Job Selection**: Finds and clicks on job title links
3. **Application Flow**: Handles the "Apply" ‚Üí "Apply Manually" flow
4. **Account Creation**: Creates account if needed using provided information
5. **Form Filling**: Fills out all application forms across multiple pages:
   - My Information (personal details, contact info)
   - My Experience (work history, skills)
   - Application Questions (job-specific questions)
   - Voluntary Disclosures (EEO information)
   - Self Identify (disability status)
6. **Form Submission**: Submits completed forms

## üéØ Supported Field Types

- **Text Fields**: Name, email, phone, address, etc.
- **Date Fields**: Individual month/day/year spinbutton inputs
- **Dropdown Fields**: Select dropdowns and searchable dropdowns
- **Radio Buttons**: Yes/No questions, multiple choice
- **Checkboxes**: Terms acceptance, preferences
- **Textarea Fields**: Long text responses

## üîç Field Detection Strategy

The system uses multiple strategies to find form fields:

1. **ID Attribute**: `input[id="fieldName"]`
2. **Data Automation ID**: `input[data-automation-id="fieldName"]`
3. **Name Attribute**: `input[name="fieldName"]`
4. **Partial Matching**: `input[id*="fieldName"]`

## üìä Form Data Extraction

The system extracts form structure and saves it to `workday_forms_complete.json` including:

- Field labels and IDs
- Field types (text, select, radio, checkbox)
- Required field indicators
- Available options for dropdowns
- Page metadata

## üêõ Debugging

Enable detailed logging by checking the console output. The system provides:

- Field detection attempts
- Successful/failed form fills
- Selector strategies used
- Error messages and troubleshooting info

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Rate Limiting**: The system includes delays to avoid overwhelming servers
- **Browser Visibility**: Runs in non-headless mode for monitoring
- **Manual Intervention**: Some complex fields may require manual completion
- **Company-Specific**: May need adjustments for different Workday implementations

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All personal information is stored locally in the `.env` file
- No data is transmitted to external servers except the target Workday site
- Use responsibly and in accordance with company application policies
